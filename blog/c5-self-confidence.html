                        In essence, self-awareness and mindfulness are the same thing -- take this analogy from chapter-four of 
                        <i>Search Inside Yourself</i>: "The traditional analogy of this mind is a fluttering flag. 
                        The flag represents the mind. In the presence of strong emotions, the mind may be turbulent like a flag fluttering 
                        violently in the wind.”
                        <br>
                        The flagpole represents <em>mindfulness</em> -- it keeps the mind steady despite all that emotional movement. 
                        In that, mindfulness is similar to self-awareness: it allows us to view ourselves with "third-person objectivity".

                        After trying the "body scan" technique covered in the book initially, I felt I wasn't able to settle properly / focus 
                        on specific areas well enough -- which I think was due to being around displays / monitors, and noise. I tried it again 
                        before sleeping, after I had put down my phone / laptop for the night: it was a great process for settling my mind / head 
                        before sleep, and finding myself being acutely aware of feelings involved with different areas of the body. 
                        Will definitely trial again before sleeping to see if it helps.

                        The quote -- "If my emotions are who I am, then there is very little I can do about it" -- stood out to me: 
                        with mindfulness and self-awareness, our emotions are not simply a part of us, but what we feel in our bodies;
                        from existential to experiental.
