                        When I was training people at McDonald's, I would always make an effort to connect with them on an empathetic-level. I found
                        that after being courteous to them, or standing up for them -- as well as facilitating their learning
                        -- they begun to trust me more than the manager's (lmao). Often I'd get new crew come to me, as they
                        were to intimidated or scared to ask management -- which I saw as a product of compassion.

                        To draw on from the last question... you'd often be required to listen to what new crew were experiencing; being able to
                        reflect and speak back to them, in a way which mirrored what they were feeling was a good way to
                        connect and build trust.
                        <br>
                        <br> I think in general, without the construct of an "exercise", people are often too scared to say what
                        they are feeling, in fear they may get shot-down, or "deflected". I feel personally, that empathic
                        listening can go a long way in helping reassure someone, or help them (even marginally).

                        I felt it was a great way to feel and build empathy, especially towards someone you care about. It's a way of understanding
                        that regardless of what you may be feeling now -- or have felt in the past -- that this person has
                        likely had similar experiences.

                        <em>Think of a difficult situation from your present or past, when there was some conflict or disagreement,
                            something real, something that has some meaning and potency for you.
                        </em>
                        <br>
                        <br> Keeping it related to my time at McDonald's lol, there was a situation where I offered to remedy
                        a customer's issue with free stuff! To me, the issue that the customer had was relatively minor --
                        i.e., it was being blown out of proportion, but I realised that there's no point in trying to argue,
                        as it would only slow service down (and probably anger the customer more).
                        <br> When the manager on floor realised I had given away something for free (trying to do something courteous
                        / nice), they were immediately angry and threatened me.
                        <br>
                        <br> To me, I was only trying to be courteous, and if it appeases both parties involved then it is a
                        good result. After explaining my decision-making to the manager afterwards, she apologised and agreed
                        that she could see where I was coming from.
                        <br>
                        <br> Conversely, I could see where she was coming from; being more concerned about the long-term benefits
                        of giving stuff away.
