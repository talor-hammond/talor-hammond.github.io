                        For me, JavaScript is a language that focusses on functionality, and logic. In itself, HTML is a static markup language, whereas 
                        JavaScript is dynamic "scripting" language. With <b><em>if</em></b> statements, webpages -- or anything else -- can be programmed 
                        to change based on certain conditions.
                        <br><br>
                        It does take longer to get your head around the logic, but having come from Swift, JavaScript shares a lot of similarities: 
                        <b><em>if</em></b> statements, and <b><em>for</em></b> and <b><em>while</em></b> loops all have the same methodology as Swift -- just different syntax. Even data objects 
                        share similar roles / functionality as <b><em>class</em></b> objects did in Swift (such as accessing properties w <b><em>dot notation</em></b>). The only difference 
                        thus far has been syntax, which seems a lot more complex (less clean-cut) than Swift.
                        <br><br>
                        The biggest thing for me, when it came to the difference between reading / learning Swift, and really understanding it, was 
                        applying it in my own projects with a trial-and-error mentality. Did end up learning a whole lot just by making mistakes, so hopefully 
                        will happen with JavaScript.

                        Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, 
                        for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.

                        From <em>Wikipedia</em>:
                        <br>
                        "control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions or 
                        function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated."
                        <br><br>
                        From JavaScript, we can initiate <b><em>for</em></b> loops to perform a series of instructions, or "iterate" over 
                        an array / series, until a certain specified condition isn't met (i.e. while a condition <em>is</em> met).
                        <br>
                        For the "brushing your teeth" parallel, a loop could be initiated telling you to continue brushing until 
                        a certain condition (like: your teeth are clean) is met.

                        Accessing data from an array requires using square-brackets to refer to an item in the array by index; remembering 
                        that indices start from 0, and not 1 like we would assume naturally. Nested objects within 
                        an array would then have to be referenced further with dot notation.
                        <br><br>
                        Data in an object can be referenced simply with 
                        dot notation: "." after the objects name, followed by the property. If the property's name has a space (" ") in it, 
                        the property must be referred to with square-brackets, "[<em>property name</em>]".

                        From <em>Mozilla</em> documentation:
                        <br>
                        "In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any 
                        other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, they are 
                        <em>Function</em> objects."
                        <br><br>
                        In my own experience, simple functions, such as reloading the data on a specific page are especially useful in certain instances, 
                        and for more complex functions you would involve certain parameters -- and then "call" it with variable inputs to 
                        get a result.
