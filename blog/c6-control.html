                        Definitely after hitting a road-block when solving a problem. Frustration definitely kicks in if it's a simple error, 
                        but I've learnt to take silly mistakes -- and any mistakes in general -- into learning-experiences, which has helped 
                        me a lot presently, and hopefully in the long run.
                        <br><br>
                        Here's a pertinent quote from <em>Search Inside Yourself</em>:
                        <br><br>
                        <em>“If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this 
                        you have the power to revoke at any moment.”</em>
                        <br><br>
                        Taking a break tends to alleviate any immediate distress that hitting a roadblock causes; tying in with this quote.

                            How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?

                            <em>Whenever you feel triggered, just stop</em>.
                            <br><br>
                            Bringing to mind an unpleasant event from the past definitely brought on lots of negative emotions. Stopping -- and breathing -- 
                            immediately alleviated most of those unhappy emotions for me, and reflecting definitely helped. As in the first question, taking a break for me helps immensely 
                            whenever I'm experiencing emotional distress, and is in general a great first option when after being triggered emotionally. 
                            It let my mind settle without provoking, or aggravating the thought in my head; and reflection tied in well with previous 
                            mindfulness practice.
                            <br><br>
                            Conversely, I did find it hard to stay completely settled for the entire duration, but found the whole experience 
                            pretty helpful, even if I (and most / some people) might do something similar sub-consciously.
                        </p>
