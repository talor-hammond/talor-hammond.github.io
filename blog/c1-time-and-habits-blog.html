    <h1>Cultural Blogs: Time and Habits</h1>

    <h2>Which timebox and habit techniques did you try?</h2>
      <p>
        <!-- italicise h3 -->
        <h3>The Pomodoro Technique</h3>
            The idea of taking breaks intermittently is something I've found to work really well -- aiming to work with time, rather than against it, is super important in any field.
            There is a sense of accountability with setting a time-related goal -- whether it be 25-minutes, an hour, etc. -- that deters distractions, and gets the most out of
            your time. For instance, I used this technique with some success in 25-minute increments when tackling this assignment!
      </p>

  <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
      <p>
        <h3>Growth-mindset vs. Fixed-mindset</h3>
            This dichotomy of dynamic-versus-static learning-psychology really stood out. Especially for tackling phase-0, and eventually the physical-bootcamp, having a growth-mindset would be
            essential for getting the most out of any opportunity -- and not putting a "cap" on learning-potential.
        <h3>Starting small</h3>
            Breaking up goals into smaller increments, and having a MVP (minimum-viable-product) is essential for building towards an idea -- seeing a goal as lots of little processes, 
            rather than one large process is super important (I think) for developers / entrepreneurs.
            <br>
            <br>
            With my own (minimal) experience building small-scale apps for iOS, having to scale back an initial idea was essential in making measurable progress, and ultimately
            reaching a bigger goal.
        <h3>Building productive habits</h3>   
            I took away a few key-points from Duhigg's and Sethi's conversation about habits:
            <ul>
                <li>
                        In whatever it takes to get you somewhere, and to do it consistently -- do that, and your attitude will follow.    
                </li>
                <li>
                        Look to ourselves for clues to who we are.
                </li>
                <li>
                        The cumulative net-effect of our behaviour(s), spills over into everything else in our lives -- that's when habit, creates change.
                </li>
            </ul>
      </p>

  <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
      <p>
          Pomodoro and the idea of small, incremental, reachable goals, are two concepts that I've used past, presently, and will aim to use and experiment with in the future.
          <br>
          <br>
          Further, I'm going to adopt a "growth-mindset", in order to continually improve and get better.
