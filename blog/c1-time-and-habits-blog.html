                        The idea of taking breaks intermittently is something I've found to work really well -- aiming to work with time, rather
                        than against it, is super important in any field. There is a sense of accountability with setting
                        a time-related goal -- whether it be 25-minutes, an hour, etc. -- that deters distractions, and gets
                        the most out of your time. For instance, I used this technique with some success in 25-minute increments
                        when tackling this sprint! Breaks did tend to be longer than 5-minutes, however...

                        <br> Breaking up goals into smaller increments, and having a MVP (minimum-viable-product) is essential
                        for building towards an idea -- seeing a goal as lots of little processes, rather than one large
                        process is super important (I think) for developers / entrepreneurs.

                        <br>
                        <br> With my own experience building small-scale apps for iOS, having to scale back an initial idea was
                        essential in making measurable progress, and ultimately reaching a bigger goal.

                        <br>
                        <br> I took away a few key-points from Duhigg's and Sethi's conversation about habits:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                In whatever it takes to get you somewhere, and to do it consistently -- do that, and your attitude will follow.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Look to ourselves for clues to who we are.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The cumulative net-effect of our behaviour(s), spills over into everything else in our lives -- that's when habit, creates
                                change.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="row">

                    <div class="five columns">
                        <p class="question">

                            Pomodoro and the idea of small, incremental, reachable goals, are two concepts that I've used past, presently, and will aim
                            to use and experiment with in the future.
