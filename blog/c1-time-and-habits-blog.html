                                <div class="paragraphBorder">
                                    The idea of taking breaks intermittently is something I've found to work really well -- aiming to work with time, rather
                                    than against it, is super important in any field. There is a sense of accountability
                                    with setting a time-related goal -- whether it be 25-minutes, an hour, etc. -- that deters
                                    distractions, and gets the most out of your time. For instance, I used this technique
                                    with some success in 25-minute increments when tackling this sprint! Breaks did tend
                                    to be longer than 5-minutes, however...

                            <p>

                                    <h3 class="italicised">Growth-mindset vs. Fixed-mindset</h3>
                                    This dichotomy of dynamic-versus-static learning-psychology really stood out. Especially for tackling phase-0, and eventually
                                    the physical-bootcamp, having a growth-mindset would be essential for getting the most
                                    out of any opportunity -- and not putting a "cap" on learning-potential.

                                    <h3 class="italicised">Starting small</h3>
                                    Breaking up goals into smaller increments, and having a MVP (minimum-viable-product) is essential for building towards an
                                    idea -- seeing a goal as lots of little processes, rather than one large process is super
                                    important (I think) for developers / entrepreneurs.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> With my own experience building small-scale apps for iOS, having to scale back an initial
                                    idea was essential in making measurable progress, and ultimately reaching a bigger goal.

                                    <h3 class="italicised">Building productive habits</h3>
                                    I took away a few key-points from Duhigg's and Sethi's conversation about habits:
                                    <ul class="blogList">
                                        <li>
                                            In whatever it takes to get you somewhere, and to do it consistently -- do that, and your attitude will follow.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Look to ourselves for clues to who we are.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The cumulative net-effect of our behaviour(s), spills over into everything else in our lives -- that's when habit, creates
                                            change.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Pomodoro and the idea of small, incremental, reachable goals, are two concepts that I've used past, presently, and will aim
                                to use and experiment with in the future.
                                <br>
                                <br> Further, I'm going to adopt a "growth-mindset", in order to continually improve and get
                                better.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
