      <h2>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</h2>
        <p>In short -- it looks, and feels like an awesome learning-environment. Shereef's words: "ownership over the environment" really stood out to me. 
            Ultimately, the result of this experience will be up to myself; what is learnt, created, developed -- a true transformational rite of passage.
        </p>

    <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
        <p>Learning about the dynamic-learning mindset individuals must have to get the most out of anything is really reassuring. Highly-concentrated learning groups are extremely important in narrowing the 
            knowledge gap between individuals; something that is essential when learning so much within a short amount of time. Learning of time-boxing, and organisational-theory was really eye-opening -- definitely something 
            I will take advantage of. Further, understanding that intangibles like soft-skills, and emotional-intelligence are imperative for this course and the future.
        </p>

    <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
        <p>
            While it involves concepts and ideas completely new to me, I'm ready to embrace the culture and learning-environment -- and look to turn mistakes into learning,
            and take ownership in order to get the most out of the experience.
        </p>

    <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
        <p>
            Of course! I'm enjoying acclimatising, 
            but it's great to see that EDA makes no half-measures when it comes to what kind of culture they want to build -- and build upon.
        </p>

    <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
        <p>
            Super excited, but also a little nervous. Ready to shake the nerves and learn as much as I can.
