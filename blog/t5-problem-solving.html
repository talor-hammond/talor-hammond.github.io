                        A few months ago, I was building a simple to-do list app for iOS with Swift, and was having issues getting my program to build, and launch.
                        <br><br>
                        After skimming the code end-to-end for a few minutes I went to Google, and found lots of resources available 
                        for errors with the same error-type, and almost hundreds of responses with possible solutions. It only took a few minutes of 
                        reading to realise that I hadn't "closed" a bracket involved with a function that was "open", and so the scope of the function was 
                        much to broad, and took in most of the other content / code / classes that I had written beneath it. As for now, I'm always looking 
                        to properly indent my code (part of the reason I skimmed over the bracket / didn't make the connection).
                    </p>

                            <li>Pseudocode
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Pseudocode is something I try to utilise whenever I'm building functions / variables: "if x happens then y should result, changing
                                         z, etc, etc". I've found it to be super effective to write, in simple terms, what a process should be performing, and then build 
                                         the code around those descriptions. I generally write this in comments, dictating what I'm trying to do.

                                </ul>

                                    <li>
                                        Feel relatively confident trying something, as there's usually no harm in doing so. Will generally 
                                        move to "Googling" after this method
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li>Rubber ducky method
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Have never tried, not sure how I feel speaking to an inanimate object... But I can see how this would help 
                                        in verbalising what you are trying to do as a developer.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>Reading error messages
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Ran into lots when using Swift & Xcode, made a habit of using debugger, and then googling the error code. 
                                        Would rinse-and-repeat this process to solve problem.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li>Console.logging
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Really useful, always use console.log or any other print method to output what you are trying to define. e.g.,
                                         would use this when setting var x to make sure I'm grabbing the right content.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li>Googling
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Most comfortable port-of-call for me, whenever any of the other methods at hand don't work. Usually directed to 
                                        StackOverflow, and there's plenty of content with examples, resources, other solutions which are a great way to learn.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li>Asking peers / coaches
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Haven't run into major blocks yet, but as I head toward the last few sprints, will definitely 
                                        look to the code-help-desk for suggestions, help, and solutions.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li>Improving your process with reflection
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Definitely make the most of learning-experiences, especially when making mistakes. Fortunate to 
                                        have made a lot of simple errors early on in programming with Swift, so feel a lot better prepared 
                                        for JavaScript, and even HTML, and CSS.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        </ul>
