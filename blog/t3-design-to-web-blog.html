                        In short, a responsive site -- or responsive web design -- ensures that the website looks good on all devices, i.e. devices
                        with different screen resolutions / displays.
                        <br>
                        <br> It's important as devices all have different screen-sizes, and w responsive web design our sites
                        can cater towards all of these. Static web design would limit the reach your site would have.

                        Mobile first design is one of the strategies used when building a responsive website. It is the idea of building a design
                        for a mobile-display first, as it is considered the most difficult (compared to building for desktop
                        / bigger displays). "Once the mobile design questions are answered, designing for other devices will
                        be easier."
                        <br>
                        <br> Mobile first design can significantly cut down the load-time for more graphic / design-intensive
                        websites.

                        Frameworks make our life easier as front-end developers, with preset CSS / styles allowing us to build our grid-based designs
                        without having to write our own code / structures.
                        <br>
                        <br> Frameworks are great for efficiency, and for building prototypes in small amounts of time; allowing
                        you to build clean and symmetrical layouts. For larger-scale websites, there will generally be limitations
                        around the framework's core behaviours. i.e., it restricts your freedom as a developer, and forces
                        you to use the framework's semantics.

                        A wireframe -- in terms of web design -- is a basic visual representation of elements on a website.
                        <br>
                        <br> We use it, as it serves as a blueprint for how our design should look, with the main focus not on
                        colour or graphics, but functionality, behaviour, and content priority.

                        Ran into a few difficulties, to do with Skeleton's default / core CSS; and building the site for mobile / smaller displays
                        and resolutions.
                        <br>
                        <br> Did some reading through StackOverflow, and visited some YouTube videos before realising it was
                        CSS overwriting some of my values -- i.e. I had my media-queries in the wrong position in the heirarchy.
                        Was a good lesson to learn, though.
