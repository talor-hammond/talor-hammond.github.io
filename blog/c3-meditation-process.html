                        Always tend to get caught up on making the design look "perfect", or as close to the wireframe as I could get, rather than
                        focussing on the actual process / idea to do with the redesign. In making it as close to the wireframe
                        / concept as possible, I did learn a lot in order to make it work.

                        To be completely honest, I've never done too much reading / research into meditation, or the mentality behind it and it's

                        Meditation is a practice that's been around for thousands of years. The concept of meta-attention was something that stood
                        out, with the "riding a bicycle" analogy a great way of describing how this idea works.
                        <br>
                        <br> Happiness is the default state of mind -- with meditation: "We are simply returning the mind to
                        its default state."

                        <br> Starting the meditation process with an intention -- a reason for wanting to meditate -- even as
                        simple as to reduce stress, seems like a good way to get in the right mindset. Given that I've never
                        meditated before, this is more speculation / theory, but I'll be trying this technique when I trial
                        meditation in practice.

                        Still really behind the idea of music, or any other outlets that you enjoy to get you in the right mindset for exercise --
